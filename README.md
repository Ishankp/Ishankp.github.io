# Graduation invitation — sample site

This repository contains a small, responsive graduation invitation page (`index.html`) with a companion stylesheet (`styles.css`). It's intended as a starting point — edit the text, date, and venue to suit your event.

How to preview locally

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → Browser).
2. Or serve it locally (recommended) using a simple static server. With Python 3 installed:

```powershell
# from the repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Publish with GitHub Pages

Because this repo is named `Ishankp.github.io`, GitHub will serve the `main` branch at `https://ishankp.github.io` automatically when you push changes to `main`.

Editing

- Update event details inside `index.html`.
- Styles are in `styles.css`.

Git quick commands (HTTPS)

```powershell
# check status
git status

# if you added/edited files
git add .
git commit -m "Customize invitation"
git push origin main
```
